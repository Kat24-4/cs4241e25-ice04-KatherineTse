**Contributors**: Katherine Tse (solo)

**Instructions**:
- Load up two windows of the web applicaiton.
- Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Start typing and watch as the progress bar moves along.
- When the first person makes it to 100%, an alert will sound letting you know who won!
- Note: This is a really basic program and therefore does not do spell check, but your typing will be displayed on the screen of the other player and so they can check how accurate you are.

**Challenges**: The biggest challenge for this project that I faced was getting used to the Svelte structure. Once I figured out what I wanted to do, it defintely took me a sec to better understand exactly how to do it with Svelte. I eventually figured it out and had pretty smooth saily from there. It did take me a second to fully grasp the data transfer but, after messing around with it a bit, I was able to figure it out.
